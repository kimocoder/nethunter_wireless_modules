If you are are taking "Learn Ethical Hacking From Scratch | Udemy" by Zaid Sabih and using Kali 2022 x64 Customized by zSecurity 1.0.7 and TP-Link TL-WN722N v2/v3 [Realtek RTL8188EUS], you might find this helpful. In the begining, I am able to enter monitor mode. However after a few days, I found out it doesn't allow to enter monitor mode. I think  TP-Link TL-WN722N v2/v3 have automatically updated its driver. Then, I find a video from David Bombal (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYnjMiTTdms) but still can't perfectly solve the issue. However, I find below steps work fine for me.

1. sudo apt update
2. sudo apt upgrade 
3. sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
4. reboot
5. sudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r)
6. sudo apt install bc 
7. sudo apt-get install build-essential
8. sudo apt-get install libelf-dev
10. sudo apt install dkms
11. sudo rmmod r8188eu.ko 
12. git https://github.com/drygdryg/rtl8188eus (This works for me ðŸ˜‚)
13. cd rtl8188eus
14. sudo -i
15. echo 'blacklist r8188eu'|sudo tee -a '/etc/modprobe.d/realtek.conf'
16. reboot
17. cd rtl8188eus 
18. sudo make && make install
19. reboot 

Like https://github.com/cccooo/rtl8812au-centos-7.6, forked from aircrack-ng/rtl8188eus and modified for CentOS 7.9
as CentOS Kernel 3.10 contains many code from 4.x

## rtl8188eus v5.3.9

# Supports
* Android 7
* MESH Support
* Monitor mode
* Frame injection
* Up to kernel v5.8+
... And a bunch of various wifi chipsets

# Howto build/install
1. You will need to blacklist another driver in order to use this one.
2. `echo 'blacklist r8188eu'|sudo tee -a '/etc/modprobe.d/realtek.conf'`
3. Reboot
4. cd rtl8188eus
5. `make && sudo make install`
6. Reboot in order to blacklist and load the new driver/module.

# MONITOR MODE howto
Use these steps to enter monitor mode.
```
$ sudo airmon-ng check kill
$ sudo ip link set <interface> down
$ sudo iw dev <interface> set type monitor
```
Frame injection test may be performed with
(after kernel v5.2 scanning is slow, run a scan or simply an airodump-ng first!)
```
$ aireplay -9 <interface>
```

# NetworkManager configuration
Add these lines below to "NetworkManager.conf" and ADD YOUR ADAPTER MAC below [keyfile]
This will make the Network-Manager ignore the device, and therefore don't cause problems.
```
[device]
wifi.scan-rand-mac-address=no

[ifupdown]
managed=false

[connection]
wifi.powersave=0

[main]
plugins=keyfile

[keyfile]
unmanaged-devices=mac:A7:A7:A7:A7:A7
```
